# EXP-2-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.


## Algorithm:
1. Start the experiment.
2. Choose a test scenario (e.g., Summarization, Coding, Explanation, or Creative Task).
3. Frame two prompts for the scenario:

   * Broad / Unstructured
   * Refined / Structured
4. Input the Broad Prompt into the AI model and record the output.
5. Input the Refined Prompt into the AI model and record the output.
6. Compare outputs based on **clarity, accuracy, and depth**.
7. Repeat steps 2–6 for multiple scenarios.
8. Document results in a comparison table.
9. Analyze differences between broad and refined prompting.
10. Conclude the experiment.

Output: <img width="1918" height="1031" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eef7d82-c29b-4773-9406-6cafaef91224" />


Refined Prompt: “Write a short 8-line poem about sunrise and hope.”

Output:<img width="1917" height="1026" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b43cf9b9-3511-4af8-a794-0ecc1bb9f2d4" />


**Comparitive Analysis Table**

| Scenario      | Broad Prompt Output        | Refined Prompt Output                  | Quality                     | Accuracy              | Depth                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Summarization | General, lengthy           | Concise, domain-specific (agriculture) | Refined clearer             | Refined more precise  | Refined adds focus            |
| Equation      | Very simple                | Complete recursive solution            | Refined more useful         | Refined correct       | Refined deeper explanation    |
| Explanation   | Covers many areas, verbose | Clear analogy + banking example        | Refined more understandable | Refined accurate      | Refined gives practical depth |
| Creative Task | Generic nature poem        | Specific 4-line poem on sunrise/hope   | Refined engaging            | Refined matches theme | Refined thematic depth        |


## Result
The experiment shows that refined prompts consistently outperform broad prompts in terms of clarity, accuracy, and contextual depth. Broad prompts often lead to generic or verbose outputs, while refined prompts generate focused, structured, and relevant responses aligned with the intended scenario. Hence, refined prompting improves the overall quality and usefulness of AI-generated outputs.
